## Database Queries

### Key SQL Patterns

**Get seller's orders:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT o.order_id, o.user_id, o.total_amount, o.total_carbon, 
       o.created_at, o.payment_status, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE p.seller_id = :seller_id
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
```

**Get seller's total sales:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) as total_revenue,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as total_orders,
       SUM(oi.carbon_footprint) as total_carbon_emitted,
       SUM(oi.quantity) as total_items_sold
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.seller_id = :seller_id
```

**Get monthly sales data:**
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(o.created_at, '%Y-%m') as month,
       SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) as revenue,
       SUM(oi.carbon_footprint) as carbon
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.seller_id = :seller_id
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(o.created_at, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC
LIMIT 12
```

## Security Features

1. **Session-based Authentication**

   - Verify user role is 'seller'
   - Redirect unauthorized users to login

2. **Ownership Verification**

   - Verify seller has access to order items

3. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation on all forms
   - Sanitized POST data
   - Type checking for numeric values

4. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Prepared statements with bound parameters
   - All user inputs properly escaped

## Styling & UI

### CSS Framework

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure all migrations (0001-0007) are applied:
```bash
mysql -u root -p carbon_sphere < database/migrations/0001_create_users.sql
mysql -u root -p carbon_sphere < database/migrations/0002_create_categories.sql
mysql -u root -p carbon_sphere < database/migrations/0003_create_products.sql
mysql -u root -p carbon_sphere < database/migrations/0004_create_carts.sql
